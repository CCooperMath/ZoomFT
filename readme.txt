ZoomFront is a fake 'steam'-style storefront that allows
users to create accounts, add friends, add funds, and view/purchase games.
It supports a basic library and tagging system. 

It is made with Flask and uses a MariaDB database to store information.

The visuals of the site are not a high priority, as the project served as 
a method of learning more about database management with SQL rather than 
web-dev practice. 

You need to manually modify the config in __init__.py to match your localdb info to properly log in.
/SQL/create.sql contains the necessary code to generate the database. 

Start the web server by running main.py.
